Decision strategies

Regular (not visible) consensus players: If the regular node has at least one visible node for a neighbor, choose the color selected by the majority of neighbor visible nodes. Otherwise, choose the color selected by the naive logistic model.

Adversaries (no consensus players): Choose the color selected by the minority of player's neighbors. If there are as many red neighbors as green, randomly pick one color with probability 0.5

Visible consensus player: Choose the color selected by the majority of player's neighbors, or randomly pick one color with probability 0.5 if there is no majority.
